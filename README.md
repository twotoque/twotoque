# 🐇 hi i'm derek! 

## Computer Science w/ UX Design Minor @ Wilfrid Laurier University <br> Graphics Administrative Assistant @ City of Toronto
I specialize in the intersection of **UX design, front-End Development, and geospatial data**.  I build tools that make data accessible and community-focused. Worked on several projects including an [learning management program for a business course](https://www.twotoque.com/bu354), [sustainable transportation research](https://www.twotoque.com/bikeshare), and [playing around with geographic graphs in a park](https://www.twotoque.com/flightpath). In my freetime you can find me in the gym, dancing, or skiing!
